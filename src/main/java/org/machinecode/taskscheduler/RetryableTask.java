/*

Role & Responsibility:
Implements the TaskT interface, encapsulating the actual work (via a Runnable action) along with retry logic.

SOLID Principles:

Single Responsibility: Focuses solely on executing its encapsulated action and managing retries.
Open/Closed: Itâ€™s designed for extension (you could create new types of tasks) without modifying its existing behavior.

Design Patterns & OOP:

Command Pattern: Acts as a concrete command holding both the action and metadata (e.g., ID, retry count).
Encapsulation: Internal state like retries and action are hidden from clients.
